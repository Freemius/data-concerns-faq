## What does Freemius do with my data and who can access it?
If you opted into usage-tracking or activated a license key for a paid product, the data collected by Freemius is securely stored on our servers and is only available to:
* You - the user/buyer of the product (through the User Dashboard) 
* The productâ€™s team (through the Developer Dashboard)
* In certain situations, the Freemius support team may assist the plugin or theme developer with their account or specific customer situations. In these cases, our technical support team members, who are legally bound to protect all data at Freemius, may have limited access to some information on a temporary basis to help resolve support issues.
