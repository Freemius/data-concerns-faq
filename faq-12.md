## How can I have my data completely removed from Freemius?
For free products, you can email support@freemius.com and we’ll remove your data from the platform.

For premium products, we are required by law to keep transactional data for at least 2 years from the date of the last payment (or refund). We cannot remove the history of payment from the system under any circumstances until after the deadline has passed.
