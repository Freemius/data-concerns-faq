# Is Freemius Spyware? -- Everything You Need to Know About Freemius Data Collection
While Freemius does have a [Privacy Policy](https://freemius.com/privacy/) that explains how we collect, process, and use data, we thought it would be useful for the WordPress community to be able to read through the frequently asked privacy-related questions and concerns, openly and transparently. We would like to clarify any misconceptions you may have about Freemius and the plugins and themes using the platform.

> _My team and I have been putting our blood, sweat and tears into building Freemius - a platform to benefit the whole WordPress community. We are very proud of what we have built and lucky to witness the impact it has on plugin and theme developers’ lives across the globe. Yet, from time to time, some critics rush into unfounded conclusions, sounding like conspiracy theories, and publicly accuse us and our partners as if we are some sort of evil spyware software, without checking any facts behind their claims. Not only is that the last thing we are doing - it’s simply not true. While it’s quite rare to see these unjustified claims, it really upsets us to find them, and they harm our brand and put our partners in an awkward position where they need to defend us._
