## What is Freemius?
Freemius is a managed eCommerce platform for selling WordPress plugins and themes. We offer an all-in-one SaaS solution to run and grow a prosperous, sustainable product business, including things like securely accept payments and subscriptions, handling license keys, serving software updates, taking care of EU VAT, cart abandonment recovery, and [much more](https://freemius.com/wordpress/features-comparison/).

We are avid fans of data and strongly believe that developing a product without knowing its users and customers is a bad practice. Instead of relying on gut feelings, guesses, and “loud” customers, Freemius, by design, helps plugin and theme companies and indie-developers make data-driven decisions about their business. .

We work closely with our selling partners community, making sure that we develop the best product that brings value to both sides - buyers and sellers (plugin and theme developers). It’s that simple. 

We don’t have any hidden agenda and we’ve been transparent about it from day one. 

This is what we have to say in response to conspiracy theorists - or anyone who has reasonable expectations of their privacy: Our goal is to deliver a platform that gives you a great experience whether you buy or sell WordPress products and nothing more than that.
