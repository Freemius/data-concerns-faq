## Does Freemius usage-tracking impact performance?
The SDK is optimized to only use the minimum required resources it needs and we keep making it more performance as we go.

The usage-tracking for opted-in users is executed once a day via a WP Cron, and only if there have been changes in the tracked data points, which means that the usage-tracking doesn't impact the performance of the site itself.
