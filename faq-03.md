## Why would I share any data with Freemius?
When you share data with Freemius you basically share data with the productâ€™s team. We are the data processor that acts on behalf of the plugin or theme developer. Think of Freemius as Google Analytics for WordPress plugins and themes, but instead of storing data about website traffic, the data is about the use of a plugin/theme.
